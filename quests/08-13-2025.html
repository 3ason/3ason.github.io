        Last week, I did one singular trade with BMNR, as I had read that BMNR had a new incoming
        CEO Tom Lee, who I believe is famous as a industry leader. Although in all honesty, I 
        still don't really know who he is. I honeslty invested in it because I was looking into 
        ethereum at that time and thought a lot of people would enter in that position. 
            </p>


    <p>
        The price went from ~$48 to $103 which I then sold for around 100% profit as my intial 
        investment was $200 so I had a profit of $200. This by far has been my best trade. 
        Again, I don't really remember looking too hard at the volume movement, I think it 
        did support evidence of a an increasing price so I bought $200 of it. If I had put in 
        $500 or $600, I would then be up around $1000 or $1200 right? However, the gift of 
        hindsight is always I could have done more. 

        Now on 7/10, the price is now back to $66.72 after dropping 10.75% from its previous price of
        73 dollars.

        To improve on this, I can do a better job learning about technical analysis and how 
        I can use techniques from Ross Cameron to read stock charts better and make a more
        accurate guess on whether the price will go up or down; significantly or unsignificantly. 
    </p>

    <p>
        There are other things I should also focus/be aware of: The next midterm is on 7/23 and I 
        cannot afford to bomb it. To not do so, I need to invest more time into the lecture and 
        the material and more time to practice this time.

      It's clear that the author of the Quartz piece had an agenda in mind, picked
      out evidence that supported that agenda, and wrote a blog post. A number of
      bloggers picked up the post and used its thesis as link bait to drive hits to
      their sites, without reading any of the cited evidence. If this is how
      “digitally native news” works, I'm opting out.

    <p><em>Update: A correction! I avoided explicitly linking to the author of the
      original article, because I find the sort of Twitter insults and witch hunts
      that often pop up to be unconstructive, and this is really about what's
      right and not who's right. The author obviously disagrees because I saw no
      end of insults until I blocked the author.</em></p>

    <p><em>Charlie Clarke was kind enough to wade through the invective and decode
      the author's one specific claim that about my illiteracy was that footnote 3
      was not rounded from 110.3 to 111. It turns out that instead of rounding
      from 110.3 to 111, the author of the article cited the wrong source entirely
      and the other source just happened to have a number that was similar to
      111.</em></p>

          There's plenty of good news in this study. The gender gap has gotten much
          smaller over the past forty years. There's room for a nuanced article
          that explores why things improved, and why certain aspects have improved
          while others have remained stubbornly stuck in the 70s. I would love to
          read that article.

          The Quartz article claims that “women who work 30 to 39 hours per week
          make 111% of what men make (see table 4)”. Table 4 is a breakdown of
          part‑time workers. There is no 111% anywhere in the table, unless
          110.3% is rounded to 111%; perhaps the author is referring to the racial
          breakdown in the table, which indicates that among Asian part‑time
          workers, women earn 110.3% of what men do per hour. Note that Table 3,
          showing a breakdown of full‑time workers (who are the vast majority of
          workers) indicates that women earn much less than men when working full
          time. To find a figure that supports the author's agenda, the author had
          to not only look at part‑time workers, but only look at part‑time Asian
          women, and then round .3% up to 1%.
